    <p>
      Nvidia Corporation[note 1] (/ɛnˈvɪdiə/ en-VID-ee-ə) is an American
      multinational technology company incorporated in Delaware and based in
      Santa Clara, California.[2] It designs graphics processing units (GPUs)
      for the gaming and professional markets, as well as system on a chip units
      (SoCs) for the mobile computing and automotive market. Its primary GPU
      line, labeled "GeForce", is in direct competition with the GPUs of the
      "Radeon" brand by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).<br />
      Nvidia expanded its presence in the gaming industry with its handheld game
      consoles Shield Portable, Shield Tablet, and Shield Android TV and its
      cloud gaming service GeForce Now. Its professional line of GPUs are used
      in workstations for applications in such fields as architecture,
      engineering and construction, media and entertainment, automotive,
      scientific research, and manufacturing design.[3] In addition to GPU
      manufacturing, Nvidia provides an application programming interface (API)
      called CUDA that allows the creation of massively parallel programs which
      utilize GPUs.[4][5] They are deployed in supercomputing sites around the
      world.[6][7] More recently, it has moved into the mobile computing market,
      where it produces Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets as
      well as vehicle navigation and entertainment systems.[8][9][10] In
      addition to AMD, its competitors include Intel and Qualcomm.[11][12]
      Nvidia announced plans on September 13, 2020 to acquire Arm Ltd. from
      SoftBank, pending regulatory approval, for a value of US$40 billion in
      stock and cash, which would be the largest semiconductor acquisition to
      date. SoftBank Group will acquire slightly less than a 10% stake in
      Nvidia, and Arm will maintain its headquarters in
      Cambridge.[13][14][15][16][17]
